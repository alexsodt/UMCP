All-atom (and molecular coarse-grained) structures (hereafter, ``molecular structure'') can be built from the continuum model by including the \code{create} command to the \code{hd} program. 
The molecular structure is created following any requested dynamics, that is, if \code{nsteps} is greater than zero.
Because any errors will halt the progress of molecular structure creation, it is recommended to load a restart file following dynamics.

The bilayer will be created from the input \code{patchPDB} PDB file of a square patch of lipid bilayer.
The \code{CRYST1} directive is necessary in the PDB file; if it is not present an error will terminate production.
Optionally a protein-structure file (PSF) may be included for the PDB (with \code{patchPSF}), which will supercede the atom, residue and segment names if the PDB file format is too limiting.

Invoking \code{create\_flip yes} will flip the input bilayer so that the positive $z$ bilayer will follow along the negative normal.
