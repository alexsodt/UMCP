\newsubsection{Local metric}

The local metric of the membrane relates changes in a particle's surface coordinates $u$ and $v$ to changes in its three dimensional Cartesian vector. 

\newsubsection{Irregular mesh points}

An irregular mesh point has valence not equal to six.
At an irregular mesh point the metric and some related properties (curvature) diverge.
Note that the tangent plane does not.
Nevertheless this is a challenge for dynamics because critical quantities ($\dot{u}$, $\dot{v}$, $c(u,v)$) are changing rapidly with time.
The solution currently adopted is to split timesteps as necessary, on a particle-by-particle basis, as they approach irregular vertices.
Not all quantities are recomputed during the time splitting, only those that do not require interaction with other particles.
